                    <p>Jadavpur is mostly presented as a boiling pot of student politics where everyone gets involved in politics. That is completely untrue. Getting involved in politics is completely up to oneself and no one is forced to join. The relations between juniors and seniors is wonderful and they are always there to help you with anything during your college days and after. The afternoons are magical.</p>
